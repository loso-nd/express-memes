Rails Web Application - Regular Expressions

As I craeted this app from scratch I experienced an influx of different emotions and I wanted to express those moments via memes and gif in order to keep the buliding process fun yet instructive at the same time. 

In this Rails application I have implemeted fully functional features similar to that of an online store. There is also a fully built React frontend application, so you can test if my API is working.

I was able to build out the Rails API to add functionality and feature required for a capstone project as a Student at Flatiron School. 

Deliverables:

Back-end Requirements ( Rails )
- Auth
- Multiple has_many through relationships
- Custome routes
- Custom controller / model methods
- Validations

Front-en Requirements ( React )
- Auth
- Redux (or external API)
- Custom CSS
Things you may want to cover:


Setup
To download the dependencies for the frontend and backend, run:

$ bundle install
$ npm install --prefix client


There is some starter code in the db/seeds.rb file so that once you've generated the models, you'll be able to test my application.


You can run your Rails API on localhost:3001 by running:

$ rails s


You can run your React app on localhost:3000 by running:

$ npm start --prefix client
